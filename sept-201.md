# Changes for September 2021

We would like studio shows to be perfectly as they were before, so AutoNews/Studio pairings are **only** a thing when WebStudio is involved.

New parts of the plan:

| First   | Second  | AutoNews        | 59:45 | 00:00 | 02:02 | Check           |
| :------ | :------ | :-------------- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :-------------- |
| Studios | Jukebox | Yes (redundant) | 0     | 0     | 0     | No              |
| Studios | Jukebox | No              | 0     | 0     | 0     | No              |
| Jukebox | Studios | Yes (redundant) | 0     | 0     | 0     | Yes (redundant) |

This means changing:

-   Jukebox -> Studios can't select WebStudio (59:45) transition
-   Studios -> Jukebox can't select WebStudio (00:00) transition
-   Studios -> Jukebox can't autoselect Jukebox (02:02) transition

Other (non-consequential changes) that result from this:

-   Jukebox -> Jukebox with AutoNews won't re-sel 5 at 00:00
-   OB -> Jukebox with AutoNews won't re-sel 5 at 00:00
-   WS -> Jukebox with AutoNews won't re-sel 5 at 00:00
