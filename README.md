### URY Auto-Switcher/Auto-Selector (whatever you wanna call it)

## How it (should) Work

* At 59 minutes past the hour, decides what four actions to do

* These are three selector commands (or do nothing) and yes/no to a studio check

* Checks at -31 seconds it has stuff to do

* Does stuff at XX:59:45, YY:00:00 and YY:02:02 based on the three selector commands (can be do nothing)

* If neccesary, does a check to make sure WS isn't on air

### Does this need a better readme, because I care about the future of URY computing and the people who may have to deal with this? 

## No.

### But it does need a better readme.
